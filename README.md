# Linux Networking Lab 🌐

This repository contains my hands-on practice and experiments while learning Linux networking and system communication.

## Goals
- Understand how networking works at a systems level  
- Practice Linux networking commands  
- Learn client–server communication  
- Explore HTTP, DNS, and ports  
- Build small networking tools  

## Topics Covered
- IP addresses and network interfaces  
- Ports and protocols (TCP/UDP)  
- Basic connectivity testing (ping)  
- Routing tables  
- Open ports and services  
- HTTP requests using curl  

## Tools Used
- Linux (WSL)  
- Bash  
- Git & GitHub  

## Learning Philosophy
I learn by experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and documenting everything step by step.
