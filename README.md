This repository contains my **hands-on networking labs and experiments** while learning Linux networking, protocols, and system-level communication.

The goal is to build real understanding by practicing commands, debugging issues, and implementing small networking experiments.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Understand networking at a systems level  
- Practice Linux networking commands  
- Learn TCP/UDP client-server communication  
- Explore HTTP, DNS, sockets, and ports  
- Build practical labs for troubleshooting and server fundamentals  

---

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- IP addressing and network interfaces  
- Ports and protocols (TCP/UDP)  
- Client-server model  
- HTTP internals (headers, lifecycle, POST basics)  
- DNS basics and resolution  
- TCP states and troubleshooting  
- Port scanning and service testing  
- Firewalls and connectivity debugging  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Linux (WSL)  
- Bash  
- Netcat (nc)  
- curl / wget  
- dig / nslookup  
- ss / netstat  
- Git & GitHub  

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
I learn by:
- experimenting  
- breaking things  
- debugging errors  
- documenting results step-by-step  

This repository is not theory-only. It is built from real terminal practice.
