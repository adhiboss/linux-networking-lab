# Linux Networking Lab 🌐

This repository contains my hands-on practice and experiments while learning Linux networking and system communication.

## Goals
- Understand how networking works at a systems level  
- Practice Linux networking commands  
- Learn client–server communication  
- Explore HTTP, DNS, and ports  
- Build small networking tools  

## Topics Covered
- IP addresses and network interfaces  
- Ports and protocols (TCP/UDP)  
- Basic connectivity testing (ping)  
- Routing tables  
- Open ports and services  
- HTTP requests using curl  

## Tools Used
- Linux (WSL)  
- Bash  
- Git & GitHub  

## Learning Philosophy
I learn by experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and documenting everything step by step.
## 📘 Learning Roadmap

- Day 1: Networking basics  
- Day 2: IP, ports, TCP vs UDP  
- Day 3: Client–server model and HTTP  
- Day 4: DNS and well-known ports  
- Day 5: Networking troubleshooting  
- Day 6: Local client–server using netcat

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong foundations in Linux networking and client–server communication for a future role in systems or backend engineering.
