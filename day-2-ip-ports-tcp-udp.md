# Day 2 – IP, Ports, TCP vs UDP

## Concepts Learned

- IP Address  
  Identifies a machine on a network.

- Port  
  Identifies a specific service on a machine.

- Protocol  
  Defines rules for communication between machines.

- TCP  
  Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.

- UDP  
  Fast, connectionless protocol.

---

## Commands Practiced

- ip addr  
- ss -tuln  
- curl http://example.com  
- getent hosts google.com  

---

## Observations

- IP + Port together identify a network service.
- TCP guarantees data delivery and order.
- UDP is faster but does not guarantee delivery.
- curl can be used to test HTTP endpoints.
- DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.

## Notes

This lab helped me understand how machines communicate using IP addresses, ports, and transport protocols.
