# Day 1 – Networking Basics

## Concepts Learned

- IP Address  
  An IP address uniquely identifies a machine on a network.

- Port  
  A port identifies a specific service running on a machine.

- Protocol  
  A protocol defines rules for communication between machines (TCP, UDP, HTTP).

- Client–Server Model  
  A client sends a request and a server responds with data.

---

## Commands Practiced

- ip addr  
  Shows network interfaces and assigned IP addresses.

- ip link  
  Shows available network interfaces.

- ping google.com  
  Tests network connectivity and DNS resolution.

- ip route  
  Displays the routing table and default gateway.

- ss -tuln  
  Shows listening services and open ports.

---

## Observations

- Every machine needs an IP address to communicate.
- Services listen on specific ports.
- ping is the fastest way to check basic connectivity.
- ss helps identify which services are running.

## Notes

This lab helped me understand the foundation of how machines communicate on a network using IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
