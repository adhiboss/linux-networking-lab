# Day 3 – Client–Server Model & HTTP Basics

## Concepts Learned

- Client–Server Model  
  A client sends a request and a server responds with data.

- HTTP Protocol  
  A protocol used for communication between web clients and servers.

- Request–Response Cycle  
  Client sends a request → Server processes it → Server returns a response.

- URL  
  Specifies the address of a resource on the internet.

## Commands Practiced

- curl http://example.com  
- curl -I http://example.com  
- ss -tuln  

---

## Observations

- curl can be used to make HTTP requests from the command line.
- curl -I fetches only HTTP headers.
- HTTP runs on top of TCP.
- The client–server model is the foundation of web communication.
- ss shows which services are listening on which ports.

## Notes

This lab helped me understand how clients and servers communicate using HTTP and how the basic web request–response cycle works.
